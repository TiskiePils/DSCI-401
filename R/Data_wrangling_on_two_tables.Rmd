## Inner Join
Inner joins return results if the keys are matched in BOTH tables.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
library(nycflights13)

head(airlines)
head(flights)

```

```{r}
#Old school
flights_joined <- merge(flights, airlines, by.x = "carrier", by.y = "carrier")
glimpse(flights_joined)
```

```{r}
flights_joined %>% 
  select(carrier, name, flight, origin, dest) %>% 
  head(3)
```

```{r}
flights_joined <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by = c("carrier" = "carrier"))
glimpse(flights_joined)
```

```{r}
flights_joined %>% 
  select(carrier, name, flight, origin, dest) %>% 
  head(3)
```

```{r}
nrow(flights)
nrow(flights_joined)
```
